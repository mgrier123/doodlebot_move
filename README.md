This is all the code used to implement the doodle bot movement for my Embedded Systems Design class, ECE 4534 at Virginia Tech. This was implemented on a Pic 32 microcontroller, used a Polulu IR sensor array as it's sole sensor, and a wifly module as it's wireless communication method. If there are any questions, feel free to ask.

Here's a video of it working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McZSd-qusxE
